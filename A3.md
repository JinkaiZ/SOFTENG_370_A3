Question 1:

1.a) What is the architecture the file is compiled to run on? 

Advanced Micro Devices X86-64



1.b) What is the type? Why is the type not EXEC (executable - see man ELF)? 

The type is Shared object file. 

This is not an executable file because an executable file is a file that is generated after linking a set of object files together using a linker. Executable file is a final file which can be directly executed by the CPU. However, this file is a intermediate file that is generated after compiling the source code which is a shared object file and cannot be directly executed by the CPU. 



1.c) Using one sentence for each type, describe the different segment types you see. You do not
need to describe the GNU extensions (starting with GNU).

PHDR - This type specifies the location and size of the program header table itself, both in the file and in the memory image of the program, it cannot occur more than once in a file and it can occur only if the program header table is part of the memory image of the program.

INTERP - This type specifies the location and size of a null-terminated path name to invoke as an interpreter and it is mandatory for dynamic executable files and can occur in shared object, it cannot occur more than once in a file and it must precede any loadable segment entry. 

LOAD - This type specifies a loadable segment which described by p_filesz and p_memsz and the bytes from the file are mapped to the beginning of the memory segment,  the p_memsz has to equal or larger than the p_filesz, the extra space in memory are filled by the value 0.  

DYNAMIC - This type specifies dynamic linking information. 

NOTE - This type specifies the location and size of auxiliary information.



1.d) From the output above or otherwise what is the interpreter in the ELF header? 

program interpreter: /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2]



1.e) Given that the program is compiled why does it have an interpreter? 

The ELF interpreter is responsible for dynamic linking. When the execution begins, the interpreter takes care of satisfying the linkage requirements of the program from user space , finding and loading the shared libraries that the program depends on, and resolving the program's undefined symbols to the correct definitions in those libraries.



1.f) In which of the program segments do you think the main function is stored? Give a reason.

The main function is stored in the LOAD segments. This segment describes areas of the new program's running memory. This includes code and data sections that come from the executable file which includes the code of the main function. 



1.g) Describe the main differences between how program segment headers and section headers in
ELF files are used. Include any web links you used to find your answer.

The program header table tells the system how to create a process image.

- Segments are described in the program header. Loosely, each segment descibes a chunk of the file to be loaded into memory when an executable is run.

- Sections are described in the section header. Loosely, each section describes a chunk of data relevant to the program. 

- Program headers are to do with execution. This is the information needed to load a program into memory and 

  execute it or to link it at run time.

  Section headers are for compile time linking by the ld command. 



Question 2:

2.a) In the header information in question 1 one of the values is the entry point address for the
file. Locate the disassembled instructions from the relevant section in the objdump output.
Include them in your answer.

00000000000010a0 <_start>:
    10a0:	f3 0f 1e fa          	endbr64 



2.b) In a general way (you don't have to give details) explain how the main function is reached
from this code.

The execution will start from the entry point address. In the Entry point address field, we can find the starting address of the executable file. According to the address, we can find the assembly code for the <_start> section. The instruction set up argument stack(loads the address of main function into rip register ) and call libc_start_main function. The libc_start_main function initialises the environments and call the main() function.

2.c)
Show the assembly language which corresponds to the main function.



2.d) When the main function returns, where does it return to? (In general, not the address.)

The main function will return to the __libc_start main function which will handle the return from main function(calling `exit()` with the return value from `main()`). 

Question 3:

3.a) Find the regions of memory mapped to this process. Show the output.



3.b) See the files behind them. Show the output.



3.c)
Comparing this information with information from the ELF file, where in memory was the
main function when the program was running? Explain how you worked that out.

The second one?



Question 4:

For bitmap need to represent each frame by 1 bit, therefore, the space is : 

2^35 / 2^13 = 2^22 bits , 

2^22 / 2^3 = 2^19 bytes. 

For linked list, as we only use half of the memory, therefore the space is : 

Total number of frames is : 2^22

Free frames: 2^22 / 2 = 2^21, we need use 2^21 nodes for each free frames,

Each node has a pointer and number, which is  64 (2^6) bits * 2 = 128(2^7) bits, 2^7 / 2^3 = 2^4 bytes.  

Total space = 2^21 * 2^4 = 2^25 bytes

How much of that space (for both approaches) would normally be in kernel memory? Why?

All the space normally be in the kernel memory. Because we cannot give a user process direct access to free space management. If the process changes an occupied frame to free, it can then access the frame being used by another process.

 How would an extents version compare to the two approaches in the question above?



Question 5:

100 seconds =  10^11 nanoseconds

For n page frames takes 100 seconds to run : 10^11 = n * 1 + 50000 * 1000000

The number of pages n = 5 * 10^10 pages

The amount of allocated pages will have one fault page occur = 5 * 10^10 / 50000 = 1000000.

For x page frames takes 60 seconds to run: 6 * 10^10 = x * 1 + x/1000000 * 1000000

6* 10^10 = 2 * x

x = 3 * 10^10 pages. 

We should allocated 3 * 10^10 pages to the program in order to have it finish in 60 seconds.
