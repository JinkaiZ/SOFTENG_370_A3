1.a) What is the architecture the file is compiled to run on? 

Advanced Micro Devices X86-64



1.b) What is the type? Why is the type not EXEC (executable - see man ELF)? 

The type is Shared object file. 

This is not an executable file because an executable file is a file that is generated after linking a set of object files together using a linker. Executable file is a final file which can be directly executed by the CPU. However, this file is a intermediate file that is generated after compiling the source code which is s shared object file and cannot be directly executed by the CPU. 



1.c) Using one sentence for each type, describe the different segment types you see. You do not
need to describe the GNU extensions (starting with GNU).

PHDR - This type specifies the location and size of the program header table itself, both in the file and in the memory image of the program, it cannot occur more than once in a file and it can occur only if the program header table is part of the memory image of the program.

INTERP - This type specifies the location and size of a null-terminated path name to invoke as an interpreter and it is mandatory for dynamic executable files and can occur in shared object, it cannot occur more than once in a file and it must precede any loadable segment entry. 

LOAD - This type specifies a loadable segment which described by p_filesz and p_memsz and the bytes from the file are mapped to the beginning of the memory segment,  the p_memsz has to equal or larger than the p_filesz, the extra space in memory are filled by the value 0.  

DYNAMIC - This type specifies dynamic linking information. 

NOTE - This type specifies the location and size of auxiliary information.



1.d) From the output above or otherwise what is the interpreter in the ELF header? 

program interpreter: /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2]



1.e) Given that the program is compiled why does it have an interpreter? 

A dynamic executable or shared object that initiates dynamic linking can have one `PT_INTERP` program header element. During execution, the system retrieves a path name from the `PT_INTERP` segment and creates the initial process image from the interpreter file's segments. The interpreter is responsible for receiving control from the system and providing an environment for the application program.



1.f) In which of the program segments do you think the main function is stored? Give a reason.

The main function is stored in the LOAD segments. The main function need to be loaded from file to memory and the data in LOAD segment will be loaded from the files into memory.  OR the execute flag.
